* [explainxkcd.com](http://explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/356:_Nerd_Sniping) explained the above comic by stating, "Nerds have a way of getting distracted easily and focusing on one thing and ignoring the rest, when they feel their specific skills are challenged by an interesting problem."

* We've all been there. :grinning:

## I sometimes write code in this project when:


* Something gets my wheels spinning. ('How might one design an elevator system'?)
* I encounter a 'kata' while browsing the web or talking to friends. (http://codekata.com/)  
* I want to practice implementation skills.
* I want to try something out before putting it in a real application, and a playground just doesn't cut it. :wrench:


## That's it?

* Yes.
* Other than run tests on itself, this app does nothing. :white_check_mark: :white_check_mark: :white_check_mark:

##  How to get started

* Pull the repo.
* Run all tests in Xcode with `command  u`.


## Explore
* This project is organized into logical classes and subdirectories.
* If you are looking for a starting point, I recommend `CommonLogic -> Katas -> CodeKata -> Kata04DataMunging -> PartOneWeatherData.swift` :umbrella: or the Unit Test, `Tests_BinarySearchTree.swift` :evergreen_tree:

## Contribute
* There are no doubt more elegant solutions to some of my problems. Feel free to contribute freely with improvements or questions.
