 Crack the Coding Interview 2.4:
 
   Write code to partition linked list around a value x, such that
   nodes less than x come before all the nodes greater than or equal to x.
   If x is in the list, the values of x only need to be after the elements less
   than x. 
 
    The partition element x can appear anywhere in the 'right partition'; 
    it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.

 Example
    3->5->8->5->10->2-> 1 (partition = 5)
    3->1->2->10->5->5->8
 
 */


class LLPartition: LinkedListNode {
    
    
    func partition() {
        
        
    
        
    
    }
}
