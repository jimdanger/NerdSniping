class LLReturnKthToLast: LinkedList {
    
    func getKthToLast(k: Int) -> LinkedListNode? {
        
        /* Whiteboard:
            - iterate through once to count, and again to find Kth to last. O(N^2)
        
            - iterate a few times, once with a runner that skips a 1000 or so,
            then again skipping 1000/2, etc. that way we could find the last one 
            a lot quicker
                - how does this even work? I guess I just loop 1000 times always advanceing to the next node without actually performaing a computation on the node
                - so for this problem (where there is no computation on the node anyway), i don't quite see how this saves computational time. It may even add time.
                -  is node.next.next the same computational speed as doing node.next twice?
         
            - Can we do better?
         
            - hmmm...
         
            - As I advance through the LL, I could keep track of the node that is k behind the current position. Then, when we get to the end, we can instantly return that node.
                - This one is the winner. this is O(N), might be hard to do better.
